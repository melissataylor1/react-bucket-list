# Module 20 Mini-Project: Bucket List

In this mini-project, you are given starter code for a React Bucket List app. Some pieces of the application are not complete, and it is your mission to take what you have learned so far and complete the app.

This project invites you to use most of the concepts you've learned in this module. You will manage state using the `useState` Hook, pass data as props to child components, and use lists and keys to render a list of bucket-list items.

## Credits

Some started code provided to us, mostly to establish file structure.
